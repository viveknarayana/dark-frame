Thank you all for not sleeping in after I heard about all the great fun last night. I figured that, you know, Lauren and I would be the only ones here, so thank you for joining us. What my hope is, and I'm very pleased to be with all of you and MEI today, my hope is that I can, in our short time today, get you to think a little differently, especially about consumers, especially about my world, which is the supermarket, and especially about trends. So what I want to do is get started by showing you an actual advertisement from about a hundred years ago. It's a picture of a hog with a child's head on the body. It says, makes children and adults as fat as pigs, no cure, no pay, price 50 cents, groves, tasteless, chill tonic, on the market over 20 years. 50 cents a hundred years ago. We're talking about a very expensive product here. Anybody want to take a guess what's in that bottle? Just yell it out. Water. Sugar water. Whiskey. We know what you were doing last night. Any other guesses? Cocaine. Fat. It was actually lard. There's a picture of my dad in one of my grandfather's milk trucks. My grandfather was a dairy farmer, and my dad taught me the most valuable lesson ever, that the supermarket was my laboratory, it was my plaything, that I could go into a supermarket, and I visit 10 to 15 supermarkets every week, no matter where I am, and I could learn everything about the people in that area, and just never to be scared to walk up to them and ask them questions. For me, the food world, our future, rests in what I call the three C's. Catering to health and wellness, creating a convenient and wow experience, and celebrating food, preparation, and taste, whether it be a manufacturer, a farmer, or a retailer.
